# Deep Thoughts
Rice Bootcamp Module Project 21: Deep Thoughts [MERN]

## Introduction

Youâ€™ll combine all four technologies of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to build a social media application called Deep Thoughts. Users will 
be able to sign up and create an account, post their thoughts, and interact with other users, just like you might find in the social media apps you use day in and day 
out in real life.

## Acceptance Criteria

Create an Apollo Server and apply it to an Express.js server as middleware.

Modify the existing authentication middleware to work in the context of a GraphQL API.

Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo server.

Build API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application.

Use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify server-side data.

Successfully configure and deploy a MERN application to Heroku.

Explain the difference between GraphQL and RESTful APIs.

Configure a proxy server for local development of a MERN application.

Implement client-side routing using React Router.

Build API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application.
